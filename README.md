# UIM-Minecraft
This is a Minecraft datapack inspired by the Ultimate Ironman gamemode in Old School Runescape. You must learn to make creative use of storage and inventory management methods. 

## Mechanics
- Your inventory is restricted to your hotbar, offhand, and equipment only. Every other slot is unusable, and attempting to place an item in it will drop the item.
- Chests generated in the world will be locked and have to be broken open to retrieve the contents.
- Minecart chests will spawn as barrels.
- Furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces generated in the world break on open.
- Entities able to hold arbitrary items like llamas and item frames will be killed upon entering interaction range. (Don't worry, elytra in end ships won't despawn.)
- Item frames, chest boats, hoppers, smokers, bundles, and ender chests aren't craftable
- Furnaces are crafted pre-loaded with a coal or coal block in the centre of the recipe. Once placed, the furnace starts immediately, and breaks once it runs out of fuel. This is to allow the smelting of items while making storage in furnaces infeasible.
