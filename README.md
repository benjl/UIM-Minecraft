# UIM-Minecraft
This is a Minecraft datapack inspired by the Ultimate Ironman gamemode in Old School Runescape. You must learn to make creative use of storage and inventory management methods. 

## Mechanics
- Your inventory is restricted to your hotbar, offhand, and equipment only. Every other slot is unusable, and attempting to place an item in it will drop the item.
- Chests generated in the world will pop and drop their contents on the ground when opened.
- Minecart chests will do the same when the player comes into interaction range.
- Furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces generated in the world will be locked.
- Entities able to hold arbitrary items like llamas and item frames will be killed upon entering interaction range.
- Chests, item frames, and any other item that can store arbitrary items are uncraftable.
- Furnaces are crafted pre-loaded with a coal block in the centre of the recipe. Once placed, the furnace starts immediately, and breaks once it runs out of fuel. This is to allow the smelting of items while making storage in furnaces infeasible.
